0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis refers to a lung disease caused by inhaling fine dust and ash.

1.  getrusage() means get resource usage. It returns resource(CPU, memory etc.) statistics.

2.  struct rusage has 16 members.

3.  Passing by value would mean copying the whole struct which will take more space than passing by reference.

4.  We start reading the text file character by character, storing the character in c. We then check whether the character
    is an alphabet or an apostrophe. If it is an apostrophe, we impose the extra condition that the index must be positive
    because a word cannot start with an apostrophe. Next we append the character to our string word. Then we check whether
    index has reached the max limit of length of a word(45 in this case). If it is indeed greater than 45 then we iterate 
    over the file till a non-alphabet is encountered(we check for EOF condition in each iteration) and set index back to zero.
    If the character is not an alphabet or an apostrophe, we check whether it is a digit. If it is a digit then we iterate
    till we encounter a non alphanumerical character (we check EOF condition in each iteration), again setting index to zero at
    the end.
    If thr character is neither an alphanumeric or an apostrophe and index is positive then we must have found the end of a word.
    So we append \0 to our string words and update the count of words. Then we record the resource usage before and after using
    check function. If the word is misspelled then we print it and increase the count of misspellings. Finally we set index back 
    to zero before the next iteration.
    
5.  If we use fscanf to read a word then again we will have to check it character by character whether it has a non aplhabet
    or a digit character.

6.  We declare parameters of check and load as constant because their parameters are passed by reference and can be
    accindently changed or freed.
